# Simple rust pixel engine

A simple pixel engine built ontop of the [pixels](https://github.com/parasyte/pixels) crate.

## Run

Clone the repo and cd into one of the examples.

From there just run `cargo run` to run the example. Keep in mind that currently the window does not play that nicely with tiling
window managers, so if you use one, temporarily switch to its built in floating mode for the best experience.
